# preliminary-experiments
First of all, thanks for taking part in this experiment. 

This postediting task is part of the research I am carrying out for the PhD in Translation And Language Sciences at Universidad Pompeu Fabra, with the supervision of Toni Badia and Antoni Oliver. The goal is to study how machine translation and quality affect postediting. We will use PET, a computer-assisted translation tool that supports post-editing. It is with its default settings. It logs both postediting time and edits (keystrokes, insertions and deletions, that is, technical effort).  
Before beginning the task, each translator needs to fill in the following form with some questions about their previous in the translation industry: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SLL5H3Q 
You need to postedit 29 segments from a English to Spanish medical text pretranslated with randomized PBMT and NMT outputs. PET requieres no previous installation. You only need to download this file. It contains the tool and the task. You need to unzip the file, double-click the folder it creates (PET-v2.0) and execute the run.bat file in Windows. If it doesn't run properly, there is probably a problem with Java. See the PET manual to obtain further information on how to solve the problem.
 Next, a window will show the Configuration (experiments.pec) and Workspace assigned you need to work with. There are two tasks available. You will be assigned one of the two. Select it and clic Start .
